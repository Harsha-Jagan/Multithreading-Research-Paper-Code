# Multithreading-Research-Paper-Code

# Description
This is the code used in the experiments conducted in the IB Extended Essay "To what extent does multi-threading affect the performance of recursive sorts more than that of non-recursive sorts?"

# Organization
  1. MainRunner.java
  
  2. Quick Sort:
    a. NonRecursive.java
    b. NonRecursive_Thread.java
    
  3. Merge Sort:
    a. NonRecursive.java
    b. NonRecursive_Thread.java
    
  4. Insertion Sort:
    a. NonRecursive.java
    b. NonRecursive_Thread.java
    
  *The NonRecursive_Thread class contains the sort for each type: nonrecursive merge, recursive merge, nonrecursive quick...
